* getBet function in head and score dtf doesnt work

* scoreCdf score mat orientation is not compiled , works on an older version  

finished a headDtf population, detected errors in the predict function of the Dtf, the func is called scorePrediction, *to be fixed.

* bagging algorithms shows problems with t1 & t2 arguments of att_dts. i don't know why!

-------------------------------------------------------------
* headdercrfv estimation attdts not optimized just copy paste from Score functions --FXed
* in  the prediction function the att_dts function called is the Scorer ones not the respective ones--Fixed
--------------------------------------------------------
1) test newly implemented crfv scripts for optimal att_dts and store to apropriate functions.

2) populate the new DTF with data from the competition

3) test the ReEvaluation method for the 2 kinds of ptype {numeric, categoric}
