!./ Human log.


*** in the datastructure i hadn;t predicted the "prediction"" phase for the diff based attrubutes and datasets.
    - about to change the @DTF object "predCalcScore" function to take into account the diff part pf the data.
    !! remove tt as parameter for the "predCalcScore" function since it is going to be global <tt> & <ntt>
    


------------------------------------------------------------
!!! create & save Dtf obj in <<C:/BastData/DTF/"country"/"comp__compid".dtf.Rdata>>
load with load(filename)

!! implemented the first full crfv for the dft objs. The get ensamble etc funcs do not work on this
    stage becuse we havent made a prediction yet.

------------------------------------------------------------


the recalculation function might not work becouse we call a variable and change its val instead of the actual object,(same problem as with the predVector ins asigment)

-----------------------------------------------
* getBet function in head and score dtf doesnt work

* scoreCdf score mat orientation is not compiled , works on an older version  

finished a headDtf population, detected errors in the predict function of the Dtf, the func is called scorePrediction, *to be fixed.

* bagging algorithms shows problems with t1 & t2 arguments of att_dts. i don't know why!

-------------------------------------------------------------
* headdercrfv estimation attdts not optimized just copy paste from Score functions --FXed
* in  the prediction function the att_dts function called is the Scorer ones not the respective ones--Fixed
--------------------------------------------------------
1) test newly implemented crfv scripts for optimal att_dts and store to apropriate functions.

2) populate the new DTF with data from the competition

3) test the ReEvaluation method for the 2 kinds of ptype {numeric, categoric}
